Recently, the ISA published a warning about [electrostatic damage to highlines](https://www.slacklineinternational.org/2025/12/electrostatics-in-highlines/). This reminded me of two moments in my slacklife. One was silly and probably no big deal, the other is the closest I've come to a mainline failure.

## The near miss

In 2020 I was organizing a segmented highline rig for the first time. The line was Lurch to Church, a 250m highline in Index, WA, a line that is now near and dear to my heart. We rigged it on 60m segments of Feather Pro and a segment of Sky Pilot.

### A ‘slight’ imperfection

While sending the webbing out, two friends and I noticed a small bump in the main webbing as it was sliding through our hands. We noticed the tip of the bump was blackened like it was burnt. The burnt tip was pin head sized. As we kept looking we noticed another burn mark between the pillowed edges and the main body of the webbing. At the time we debated if they were burn marks and what could have caused them. We figured that 1 or 2 lengthwise strands were compromised which should be a 10% or 20% loss in strength at worst, no? We decided to put tape over the damaged areas to protect them and sent the webbing out. I wish I had taken photos of the damage at this stage.

### A surprise after derig

After sessioning the line for two days, we derigged. We were weekend warriors and it was time to head back to work. In the parking lot we took the tape off the damaged bits and noticed the pin head burn mark and burnt pillowed edges had grown into two major tears. Only about half of the webbing remained intact. Obviously we were freaked out.

### How did this happen?

I had bought the feather pro used from a trusted friend and inspected it upon purchase. I didn't find the burn marks then. Unfortunately, it had been rigged on Castleton during a storm. Given what we know now, electrostatic discharge arcing under the tapes is the most likely explanation for the burn marks. At the time this theory was around, but not widely accepted. We couldn’t decide if the cause was leash fall damage or static discharge. We had no working model of how electrical charge would pass down a line made of plastic which should be an insulator.

The right choice would have been to keep that damaged section out of the air, but we were motivated to get the line up. We had all gathered out at Index, devoted our weekend to this outing and hiked up to anchors. The webbing was already going out. It was an easy to decide that it was only a minor problem that wouldn't lead to a failure when we would have had to cancel our plans if we accepted the webbing was compromised and unsafe to rig.

I took the damaged section to Jerry later that year and it failed at 6kn in his break test. If the line had been rigged for even one more day, we likely would have had a mainline failure. On this particular highline, a main line failure would probably have only led to an extra large whip for the walker.

## Static Hair Day

In 2023 I was walking a 420m perma-rig in Chekamus canyon, Squamish. The line is close enough to some powerlines to hear their buzz. While walking to the home side of the line with 4 leashes tied to my harness, my hair began to stand up straight as if I was touching a plasma ball! I don’t recall there being any storms in the area, but I’m still unsure what caused this particular build up of static electricity because I’ve walked several leashed back at once before. Perhaps I was sliding my feet more than usual? Surely the nearby powerlines played some part?

## Increasing Safety Margins

It’s good that we now have a theory of how electrical charge can propagate through highline. I don’t know if I’m going to sew my backups to my mains as the riggers of [Ananatopisme](https://www.slacklineinternational.org/2022/08/ananatopisme/) did, but I am curious about water permeable and conductive tapes. Given that backup twists could cause dry spots as well, perhaps these are simply nice-to-haves, while getting highlines out of the air whenever a thunderstorm is in the area is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the line.

I plan to pick a minimum forecasted distance for thunderstorms as a derig criteria, similar to forecasted wind speed limits. Given that the damage from electrical discharge is minor, and often hidden under tapes, this highlights the need to derig any line that has gone through a storm without getting on it. Hopefully we can continue to derig  ‘big’ lines before one goes through a storm and we are forced to lay it down instead of clipping it to a curtain.
